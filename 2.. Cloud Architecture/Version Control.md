### Version Control

**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later. It is commonly used in software development to manage source code changes but can be applied to any type of digital file.

### Key Concepts of Version Control

1. **Repository:**
    
    - A repository (repo) is a central location where data is stored and managed.
    - It contains all the project files and the history of all changes made to those files.
    - Repositories can be local (on a developer's computer) or remote (on a server).
2. **Commit:**
    
    - A commit is a recorded change to the repository.
    - Each commit has an associated message describing the change.
    - Commits allow you to track and understand the history of changes in the project.
3. **Branch:**
    
    - A branch is a parallel version of the repository.
    - Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously.
    - Merging branches integrates the changes from different branches back into the main project.

### Types of Version Control

1. **Local Version Control:**
    
    - All version history is stored on the local machine.
    - Simple and easy to use but limited to a single user's computer.
    - Example: RCS (Revision Control System).
2. **Centralized Version Control:**
    
    - A single, central server stores all the versioned files, and clients check out files from this central place.
    - Facilitates collaboration by providing a common repository.
    - Examples: CVS (Concurrent Versions System), SVN (Apache Subversion).
3. **Distributed Version Control:**
    
    - Every developer's working copy of the code is a complete repository.
    - Supports multiple repositories, with each user having a local copy of the entire project history.
    - Facilitates better collaboration and offline work.
    - Examples: Git, Mercurial.
