### What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (rather than physical) version of something, such as computer hardware, storage devices, or network resources. It allows multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical hardware system, effectively sharing the resources. This abstraction layer enables more efficient utilization of physical hardware and simplifies management.

- Virtualization is the process of creating a software or virtual base of something i.e. server, storage, network desktop etc.
- What makes virtualization feasible is something called the hypervisor 
- Hypervisor is a software layer that sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machine
- They essentially pool the resources from the physical servers and allocate them to the virtual environments
### Different Types of Virtualization
#### Server Virtualization

Server virtualization is a technology that allows multiple virtual servers (virtual machines or VMs) to run on a single physical server optimizing resource utilization and providing flexibility, scalability, and improved disaster recover. Each virtual server operates independently, with its own operating system and applications, even though they share the underlying physical hardware.
##### How Does Server Virtualization Work?
Server virtualization works through a software layer called a **hypervisor**. The hypervisor abstracts and isolates the hardware resources of the physical server, creating and managing virtual machines. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it functions:

1. **Hypervisor:**
    - The hypervisor is a software layer that sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines. There are two types of hypervisors:
        - **Type 1 (Bare-Metal) Hypervisors:** These run directly on the physical hardware, providing high performance and efficient resource management. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and XenServer.
        - **Type 2 (Hosted) Hypervisors:** These run on top of an existing operating system, making them easier to install and use on desktop environments. Examples include VMware Workstation and Oracle VM VirtualBox.
2. **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
    - Each VM is an isolated environment with its own operating system and applications. VMs share the physical hardware resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces, which are managed and allocated by the hypervisor.
3. **Resource Allocation:**
    - The hypervisor dynamically allocates resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) to each VM based on its requirements and predefined configurations. This allows for efficient utilization of the physical server’s resources.
4. **Isolation:**
    - Each VM operates independently, and issues in one VM do not affect others. This isolation enhances security and stability.
##### Benefits and drawbacks 
While server virtualization offers numerous advantages such as cost savings, simplified management, and enhanced security, it also presents challenges including performance overhead, complexity, and potential resource contention. Proper planning and management are essential to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of server virtualization. [[Utility/More Virtualization#Server Virtualization|MORE]]

#### Storage Virtualization

##### What is Storage Virtualization?

Storage virtualization is the process of abstracting physical storage resources across multiple storage devices into a single, unified virtual storage pool. This abstraction allows for more efficient management, allocation, and utilization of storage resources, making it easier to manage and scale storage infrastructure.

Key platforms like VMware vSAN, IBM Spectrum Virtualize, NetApp ONTAP, Microsoft Storage Spaces Direct, and Dell EMC VPLEX provide robust solutions for implementing storage virtualization in various environments.

##### How Does Storage Virtualization Work?

A storage software is used to pool together storage from different devices which can be spread across a network. This pooled storage can then be managed from a single console/UI making it easier to allocate storage space, making back ups and ensure data is evenly distributed. To the user or admin virtual storage appears as a single storage e unit even though its made up from multiple different storage devices 

Storage virtualization works by creating a layer of abstraction between physical storage devices and the applications or users that access the storage. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:

1. **Virtualization Layer:**
    - A software or hardware-based layer sits between the physical storage devices (such as hard drives, SSDs, and storage arrays) and the storage consumers (applications, VMs, users).
    - This layer abstracts the physical storage resources and presents them as a unified, logical storage pool.
2. **Logical Storage Units:**
    - The virtualization layer divides the physical storage into logical units, such as virtual volumes, virtual disks, or storage pools.
    - These logical units are what applications and users interact with, rather than the underlying physical hardware.
3. **Storage Management:**
    - The virtualization layer manages the allocation, provisioning, and de-allocation of storage resources dynamically based on demand and predefined policies.
    - It can optimize the use of storage resources by implementing features like thin provisioning, deduplication, compression, and automated tiering.
4. **Access and Performance Optimization:**
    - The virtualization layer can optimize access to storage by caching frequently accessed data and balancing loads across multiple physical storage devices.
    - It can also provide advanced data protection features such as snapshots, replication, and backup integration.

##### Benefits and drawbacks
Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage resources to create a unified and efficient storage pool, offering numerous advantages such as improved resource utilization, simplified management, scalability, and cost savings. However, it also introduces complexity, potential performance overhead, and security concerns that need to be managed carefully.  [[Utility/More Virtualization#Storage Virtualization|MORE]]




#### Network Virtualization
##### What is Network Virtualization?

Network virtualization is the process of combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a single, software-based administrative entity, known as a virtual network. It abstracts the physical network resources, allowing multiple virtual networks to run on a single physical network infrastructure. This separation enables more efficient utilization of network resources and enhances network flexibility, scalability, and manageability. 

- Network virtualization uses software to aggregate and manage the physical network  hardware and software into a unified network service this create a virtualized network environment that appears as a single network entity from a management perspective 
- Users can manage this network centrally and deploy new services and make necessary adjustment efficiently 
- Network virtualization is a transformative approach in networking it enables ,ore efficient and flexible management of network resources it abstracts the complexity of physical networks and allows for simpler and centralized management of network functionalities 
- Key platforms like VMware NSX, Cisco ACI, Microsoft Azure Virtual Network, Google Cloud Virtual Network, and OpenStack Neutron provide robust solutions for implementing network virtualization in various environments.

##### How Does Network Virtualization Work?

Network virtualization involves creating a virtual network that functions independently of the physical network infrastructure. Here's how it typically works:

1. **Abstraction Layer:**
    - Network virtualization adds an abstraction layer on top of the physical network hardware. This layer can be managed using software-defined networking (SDN) controllers or network function virtualization (NFV) frameworks.
2. **Virtual Network Components:**
    - **Virtual Switches and Routers:** These are software-based versions of physical switches and routers that handle data traffic within the virtual network.
    - **Virtual Network Interfaces (vNICs):** These virtual interfaces connect virtual machines (VMs) or containers to the virtual network.
    - **Network Functions:** Virtualized network functions (VNFs) like firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems run as software instances.
3. **Overlay Networks:**
    - Virtual networks are often implemented as overlay networks, which run on top of the physical network infrastructure. Technologies like VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) or GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) are used to encapsulate virtual network traffic.
4. **Control Plane and Data Plane:**
    - The control plane (which makes decisions about where traffic is sent) is separated from the data plane (which actually forwards the traffic). This separation is a key principle of SDN.
    - The SDN controller manages the control plane, providing centralized management and control over the network.
5. **Network Policies and Segmentation:**
    - Administrators can define network policies, such as access controls and traffic prioritization, and segment the virtual network into multiple isolated virtual networks.

##### Benefits and drawbacks
It enhances resource utilization, provides greater flexibility, simplifies network management, and offers cost savings and improved security. However, it also introduces complexity, potential performance overhead, and new security challenges  [[Utility/More Virtualization#Network Virtualization|MORE]]

#### Desktop Virtualization

##### What is Desktop Virtualization?

Desktop virtualization is a technology that separates the desktop environment and associated application software (i.e OS & data) from the physical client device that is used to access it. This technology allows users to access their desktop and applications from various devices, such as PCs, tablets, or smartphones, through a centralized server or data center.

##### How Does Desktop Virtualization Work?

Desktop virtualization works by hosting desktop environments on a central server rather than on individual physical devices. There are several approaches to desktop virtualization, including Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), Remote Desktop Services (RDS), and Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS). Here's how these approaches typically work:

1. **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):**
    - **Centralized Servers:** Desktops are hosted on virtual machines (VMs) running on centralized servers in a data center.
    - **Connection Broker:** Users connect to their virtual desktops through a connection broker, which manages the authentication and session management.
    - **Remote Display Protocols:** Protocols like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), PCoIP (PC over IP), or HDX are used to transmit the desktop environment to the user's device over the network.
2. **Remote Desktop Services (RDS):**
    - **Session-Based Desktops:** Instead of individual VMs, users access shared sessions on a server operating system.
    - **Remote Access:** Similar to VDI, users connect to their sessions using remote display protocols.
3. **Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS):**
    - **Cloud-Based:** Desktop environments are hosted in the cloud by a third-party provider.
    - **Subscription Model:** Users access their desktops over the internet, typically through a subscription model, eliminating the need for on-premises infrastructure.

##### Benefits and drawbacks
Desktop virtualization offers significant advantages such as cost savings, improved security, flexibility, simplified management, and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities. However, it also presents challenges including initial setup costs, performance and latency issues, complexity, and dependency on network connectivity.
