### What is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting computers, devices, and systems to enable communication and data exchange

Networking involves the interconnection of devices and systems to form a communication infrastructure. This infrastructure allows for the exchange of data, information, and resources among connected entities. Networking can be implemented using both hardware (such as routers, switches, and cables) and software (such as protocols and algorithms).

The elements of networking involves Data transmission, resource sharing, communication channels and connectivity protocols
#### Purpose of Networking

The 3 main purposes of in networks are resource sharing, communication and Data exchange and collaboration
##### 1. Resource Sharing:

Networks facilitate resource sharing by allowing multiple users and devices to access common resources. These resources can include:

- **Hardware Resources:** Devices such as printers, scanners, and storage devices can be shared across a network. For example, a printer connected to a network can be accessed by multiple users from different locations within an organization, eliminating the need for each user to have a dedicated printer.
- **Software Resources:** Applications and software services can be hosted on network servers and made accessible to users across the network. This centralized hosting of software enables efficient management, updates, and licensing. Users can access the software they need from their own devices without the need for individual installations.
- **Data Resources:** Data stored on networked servers or cloud storage can be shared 
- and accessed by another device within the same network . This enables collaboration on documents, sharing of files, and access to centralized data repositories. Networked storage solutions also provide data redundancy and backup capabilities, ensuring data integrity and availability.
- **Internet  Connection Sharing:** A single network can provide internet access to multiple devices whether through a wired ethernet connection or wireless WIFI 

##### 2. Communication:

Networks serve as the foundation for communication among users, devices, and systems. They enable various forms of communication, including:

- **Email and Messaging:** Networks support email servers and messaging platforms that allow users to send and receive messages, documents, and multimedia content. Email and messaging systems facilitate asynchronous communication, enabling users to communicate regardless of their physical location or time zone.
- **Voice and Video Communication:** Networks enable real-time voice and video communication through technologies such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and video conferencing. These technologies allow users to conduct virtual meetings, collaborate on projects, and communicate effectively with colleagues, clients, and partners.
- **Instant Messaging and Chat:** Network-based instant messaging and chat applications provide real-time text-based communication among users. These platforms support group chats, file sharing, and presence detection, enhancing collaboration and productivity in organizations.
- **Protocols:** Govern how different types of communication happens over the network 
	- HTTP/HTTPS: Web Traffic
	- SMTP: Email
	- FTP: File Transfer 

##### 3. Data Exchange and Collaboration:

Networks facilitate the exchange of data and enable collaboration among users and systems. This includes:

- **File Transfer:** Networks support the transfer of files and data between devices using protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), and HTTP(S). File transfer capabilities enable users to share documents, multimedia files, and other data across the network. Secured data transfer is ensured through encryption protocols and secure network configurations 
- **Document Collaboration:** Networked document management systems and collaboration platforms allow multiple users to collaborate on documents in real-time. Users can edit documents, track changes, leave comments, and review revisions collaboratively, regardless of their physical location.
- **Project Collaboration:** Network-based project management tools and collaboration platforms enable teams to plan, track, and manage projects collaboratively. These platforms support task assignment, milestone tracking, file sharing, and communication among team members, facilitating effective project collaboration and coordination.
