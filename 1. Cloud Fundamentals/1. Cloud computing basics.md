## What is cloud computing 

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resource at scale. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. 

Here’s a breakdown of key components and characteristics of cloud computing

### Key Components:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. These recourses include servers, storage space and networks. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Users can rent virtual machines and storage.
    
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**  Offers an environment (hardware and software tools) to developers to build, test and deploy software applications without worrying about any underlying infrastructure. Examples include AWS, AZURE, GCP
    
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365,  Salesforce and Netflix

### Characteristics:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can provision computing resources as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
    
2. **Broad Network Access:** Resources are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
    
3. **Resource Pooling:** The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.
    
4. **Rapid Elasticity and scalability:** Cloud computing allows you to quickly increase or decrease the amount of computing resources based on your needs. This provides flexibility for the users and allows them to use as much or little resources they want at any time. 
    
5. **Measured Service:** Cloud systems can automatically measure and manage how much of their cloud services you are using  (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). This allows the system to adjust resources to fit your needs and provides the ability to see and control what you are using and how much you are getting charged


### Deployment Models:
Cloud services: servers , storage, databases, networking and software
#### 1. Public Cloud:

The public cloud is a model where cloud services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations. The infrastructure is owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**Characteristics:**

- **Cost-Effective:** Because the infrastructure costs are spread across multiple users, it can be more affordable.
- **Scalability:** Virtually unlimited scalability with access to a large pool of resources.
- **Maintenance:** The cloud provider manages maintenance, upgrades, and security.
- **Accessibility:** Services are available to anyone with internet access.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Multiple users share the same infrastructure, but data and applications are isolated from each other.

**Use Cases:**

- Hosting websites and applications.
- Storage and backup solutions.
- Development and testing environments.
- High-performance computing tasks.

#### 2. Private Cloud:

A private cloud refers to cloud infrastructure that is exclusively used by a single organization. It can be hosted internally or by a third-party provider. The organization has greater control over the infrastructure and can customize it to meet specific needs.

**Characteristics:**

- **Security and Compliance:** Enhanced security and compliance, suitable for sensitive data and regulated industries.
- **Customization:** Greater flexibility to customize hardware and software.
- **Control:** Full control over data, applications, and policies.
- **Isolation:** Resources are not shared with other organizations.

**Use Cases:**

- Organizations with strict regulatory and compliance requirements.
- Businesses needing high levels of data security.
- Enterprises requiring custom solutions and dedicated resources.

#### 3. Hybrid Cloud:

The hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model provides greater flexibility and optimization by leveraging the best of both worlds.

**Characteristics:**

- **Flexibility:** Organizations can keep sensitive data on a private cloud while leveraging the public cloud for less critical resources.
- **Cost Management:** Optimize costs by using public cloud resources for variable workloads and private cloud for stable workloads.
- **Scalability:** Ability to scale out to the public cloud when demand spikes.
- **Interoperability:** Seamless integration and communication between public and private clouds.

**Use Cases:**

- Dynamic workloads, such as online shopping websites during peak seasons.
- Big data processing that requires large-scale compute resources.
- Disaster recovery and backup solutions that span private and public clouds.

### Benefits:

Cloud computing lets you use and pay for only the computer services you need, other benefits include; 

- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces capital expenses since resources are rented on-demand
- **Scalability:** Easily able to scale up or down the computing power based on user needs.
- **Performance:** Offers high-performance capabilities due to vast network of servers.
- **Security:** Many cloud providers offer robust security measures to protect data.
- **Accessibility:** Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection and makes it easier for collaborations 

### Common Use Cases:

- **Data Storage and Backup:** Storing and backing up files remotely to access them from anywhere.
- **Web Hosting:** Hosting websites and applications.
- **Software Development:** Developing and testing applications in virtual environments.
- **Big Data Analytics:** Processing and analyzing large datasets to gain insights.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):** Running AI and ML models.
